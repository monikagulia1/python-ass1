Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos'


concatination happen when all are of string type .
In this case , 99 is integer not string so it will show error.
To get result , put 99 in siingle quotes or in double quote which make 99 a string type.
'I have eaten' + '99' + 'burritos'
this will give
'I have eaten 99 burritos'
