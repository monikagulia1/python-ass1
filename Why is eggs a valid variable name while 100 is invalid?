Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
 as eggs is a variable
but 100 is not variable
to define any variable there are some predefined rule and 100 does not staisfy that.
Officially, variable names in Python
can be any length and can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters ( A-Z , a-z ), digits ( 0-9 ), and the underscore character ( _ ). 
An additional restriction is that, although a variable name can contain digits, the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit.
